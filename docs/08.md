## Use OCI DevOps to build the app native executable using GraalVM Enterprise

- Create an ONS Notification with Email Subscription.
- Create a new DevOps Project.
- Go to `DevOps Project >> External Connections` and create a new external connection. Select `Type: GitHub`. Select the Vault and your Personal Access Token (PAT) Secret from the vault.

1. If you haven't already mirrored your GitHub repo, mirror the GitHub repo `DevOps Project >> Code Repositories >> Mirror repository`.

2. Each time you make a change to the GitHub repo, synchornize the changes in the OCI repo `DevOps Project >> Code Repositories >> github_graal-containers >> Synchronize now`.

3. Create a `Build pipeline`. 

4. From `Build pipelines >> Parameters`, add a new parameter with the following details:
    ```
    Name: REGISTRY_NAME
    Default value: container-registry.oracle.com
    ```
    Click `+` to add.

5. From `Build pipelines`, add a `Stage >> Managed Build` to the build pipeline. Enter the following details:
    ```
    Stage name: Build the app native executable in the native-image-ee container

    Description: Build the app native executable in the native-image-ee container

    Build spec file path: devops-build-spec/build_spec_native_exec_ee.yaml
    ```
    For the `Primary code repository`, select the following values:
    ```
    Source: Connection type: OCI Code Repository
    
    From the list of repos, select the "github_graal-containers" repo.

    Select Branch: main

    Build source name: gvmee-native
    ```
    Leave all other values unchanged.

7. Test the build pipeline by clicking the `Start manual run` button.

8. Add artifact. Enter the following details: 
    ```
    Name: jibber-ni-gvmee22-jdk17

    Type: Container image repository

    Enter the fully qualified path to the image in Container Registry: (replace the values based on your region and tenancy namespace)
        phx.ocir.io/your-tenancy-namespace/gvmee/jibber-ni-gvmee22-jdk17:${BUILDRUN_HASH}

    Replace parameters used in this artifact:
        Yes, substitute placeholders
    ```
    Click Add.

9. Add a `Stage >> Deliver artifacts` after the Managed Build stage.
    ```
    Stage name: Push the runtime image containing the app native executable to OCIR

    Description: Push the runtime image containing the app native executable to OCIR

    Select artifacts: jibber-ni-gvmee22-jdk17

    Associate artifacts with build result:
        Destination DevOps artifact name: jibber-ni-gvmee22-jdk17
        Type: Docker image
        Build config/result artifact name: Build_output_image (should match the "name" of the "outputArtifacts" from your build_spec_native_exec_ee.yml file)
    ```

10. Go to OCIR and create an empty Private Repository named `gvmee/jibber-ni-gvmee22-jdk17` in your compartment.

11. Test the build pipeline again by clicking the `Start manual run` button. The runtime image should be pushed to the OCIR repo. 

12. To test the image on local, 
    - Update the image and tag in the docker-compose.yml file for the `jibber-ni-gvmee-jdk17` service. 
    - As the OCIR repo is private, you will need to docker login to OCIR in your region. Note that OCIR stands for OCI Registry which is different from OCR (Oracle Container Registry).
    - If you haven't already logged in, run `docker login phx.ocir.io` in a terminal window. When prompted, enter your `tenancy namespace/OCI user name` as the Username, and your `auth token` as the Password. 
    - Run `docker compose up --remove-orphans` to start the application on port 8082.
    - Run `docker ps -a` to check status of the running container.
    - Go to http://localhost:8082/jibber in a browser and you should see a nonsense verse.
    - Run `docker compose stop` in another terminal window to stop the application.
