## App JAR

### Build the App JAR with GraalVM Enterprise Edition

You can use GraalVM Enterprise JDK to generate a JAR for this app. We have a shell script that uses multistage Docker build to build a JAR file using Maven and ship the app JAR in a separate runtime docker image.

```bash
./scripts/build-jar-ee.sh
```

If you are prompted to `docker login` to OCR, enter your OCR user and password.

Run this command to see the docker image:

```bash
docker images -a
```

The output is similar to:
```
REPOSITORY                 TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
jibber-jar-gvmee22-jdk17   0.0.1    4cc0f93ca0eb   41 seconds ago   669MB
```

### Run the App JAR

A Docker Compose file has ben provided that will start the container. Most sections have been commented out. Feel free to uncomment sections, as needed.

Go to [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml), comment the `jibber-ni-gvmee-jdk17:` section. Uncomment the `jibber-jar-gvmee-jdk17:`  section and run the following command to run the app JAR.

```bash
docker compose up --remove-orphans
```

This will start the app JAR on port 8080. Go to http://localhost:8080/jibber in a browser and you should see a nonsense verse.


### Stop the App JAR

From another terminal window, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose stop
```
