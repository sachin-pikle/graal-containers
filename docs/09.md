## Manually deploy the app native executable on OKE and test it

Let's see how we can deploy the app on OKE and test it. The app native executable is in the runtime container image published to a private OCIR repo by the DevOps Build Pipeline in the previous section.

1. If you haven't already, go to the `OCI Console >> Developer Services >> Kubernetes Clusters (OKE) >> Create Cluster >> Quick Create` to create a single node OKE Cluster in your compartment.

2. From the OKE cluster details page, go to `Quick Start >> Access Your Cluster`, download the kubeconfig file and set up your local environment.

3. As our runtime image is in a private OCIR repo, we will need a Kubernetes secret for OKE to pull the image from OCIR. Note that OCIR stands for OCI Registry which is different from OCR (Oracle Container Registry). 

4. Before creating a Kubernetes secret, we should store our auth token as a secret in the OCI Vault created in the previous section.

5. Before running the command to create a Kubernetes secret, set the following environment variables. Replace the `<placeholder-value>` with your values.
    ```shell
    export k8s_secret_name='ocircreds'
    export k8s_secret_namespace='default'
    
    #### Replace the '<placeholder-value>' with your values:
    export region_registry='<region-code>.ocir.io' ## e.g., 'phx.ocir.io'
    export tenancy_namespace='<tenancy-namespace>' ## e.g., 'ansh81vru1zp'
    export oci_username='<OCI-user-name>' ## e.g., 'john.doe@acme.com'
    export email_address='<email-address>' ## e.g., 'john.doe@acme.com'

    #### Use your auth token secret OCID from your Vault:
    export vault_secret_ocid='ocid1.vaultsecret.oc1.phx.ama...ilq'
    ```

6. Run this command to create a Kubernetes secret. This command uses the environment variables set above.
    ```shell
    #### Create the Kubernetes secret:
    kubectl create secret docker-registry ${k8s_secret_name} \
        -n ${k8s_secret_namespace} \
        --docker-server=${region_registry} \
        --docker-username=${tenancy_namespace}/${oci_username} \
        --docker-email=${email_address} \
        --docker-password=`oci secrets secret-bundle get --raw-output --secret-id ${vault_secret_ocid} --query "data.\"secret-bundle-content\".content" | base64 -d` 
    ```

    The output is similar to:
    ```
    secret/ocircreds created
    ```

    The k8s_secret_name `ocircreds` should match the value of `spec.template.spec.imagePullSecrets.name:` in the [oke_manifest_native_exec_ee.yaml](../oke-manifests/oke_manifest_native_exec_ee.yaml).

7. Update the value of the `spec.template.spec.containers.image:` in the [oke_manifest_native_exec_ee.yaml](../oke-manifests/oke_manifest_native_exec_ee.yaml) to use the latest image and tag published to the OCIR repo by the DevOps Build Pipeline in the previous section.

8. Deploy the selected image from the OCIR repo using the following command:
    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f ./oke-manifests/oke_manifest_native_exec_ee.yaml
    ```

    The output is similar to:
    ```
    deployment.apps/jibber-ni-gvmee22-jdk17-deploy created
    service/jibber-ni-gvmee22-jdk17-service created
    ```
    
    This will deploy the selected image and start the container in your OKE cluster. It will provision an OCI Load Balancer, and expose the app using the external (public) IP address of the load balancer.  

9. Check the status of the deployment.
    ```shell
    kubectl get deployments -o wide
    ```

10. Check the status of the pod.
    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -o wide
    ```

11. Get the load balancer's external (public) IP address by running this command:
    ```shell
    kubectl get svc -o wide
    ```

12. To test the app running on OKE, go to `http://<EXTERNAL-IP>/jibber` in a browser and you should see a nonsense verse.

13. To check the pod logs, run this command:
    ```shell
    kubectl logs -l app=jibber-ni-gvmee22-jdk17
    ```

14. To delete the OCI Load Balancer and the app-related resources (deployment, pod, service) from the OKE cluster:
    ```shell
    kubectl delete -f ./oke-manifests/oke_manifest_native_exec_ee.yaml
    ```

    The output is similar to:
    ```
    deployment.apps "jibber-ni-gvmee22-jdk17-deploy" deleted
    service "jibber-ni-gvmee22-jdk17-service" deleted
    ```
