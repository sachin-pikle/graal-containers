## App JAR

### Build the App JAR with GraalVM Community Edition

You can use GraalVM Community JDK to generate a JAR for this app. We have a shell script that uses multistage Docker build to build a JAR file using Maven and ship the app JAR in a separate runtime docker image.

```bash
./scripts/build-jar-ce.sh
```

Run this command to see the docker image:

```bash
docker images -a
```

The output is similar to:
```
REPOSITORY                 TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
jibber-jar-gvmce22-jdk17   0.0.1    4c23c1f3fb2d   24 seconds ago   656MB
```

### Run the App JAR

A Docker Compose file has ben provided that will start the container. Most sections have been commented out. Feel free to uncomment sections, as needed.

Go to [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml), comment the `jibber-ni-gvmee-jdk17:` section. Uncomment the `jibber-jar-gvmce-jdk17:`  section and run the following command to run the app JAR.

```bash
docker compose up --remove-orphans
```

This will start the app JAR on port 8081. Go to http://localhost:8081/jibber in a browser and you should see a nonsense verse.


### Stop the App JAR

From another terminal window, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose stop
```
