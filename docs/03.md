## App JAR

### Build the App JAR

We have a shell script that uses multistage Docker build to build a JAR file (using `mvn`) and ship the app JAR in a separate runtime docker image.

```bash
./step0.sh
```

If you are prompted to `docker login` to OCR, enter you OCR user and password.

Run this command to see the docker image:

```bash
docker images -a
```
Here's the output of the command:
```
REPOSITORY                   TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
jibber-jar-gvmee2130-jdk17   0.0.1    40d34310d953   2 hours ago   613MB
```

### Run the App JAR

A Docker Compose has ben provided that will start the container, plus cAdvisor and Prometheus. Most sections have been commented out. Feel free to uncomment sections, as needed.

The other tools - cAdvisor and Prometheus - will allow us to generate pretty graphs of the RSS (Resident Set Size) for the application running in the container.

With the `jibber-jar-gvmee-jdk17:` section uncommented, run the following command to run the app JAR.

```bash
docker-compose up --remove-orphans
```

This will now start the folloing version of the app, on port 8081. Access the following URL in a browser and you should see a nonsense verse. 

* Java: http://localhost:8081/jibber

### Stop the App JAR

From another terminal window, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose stop
```
