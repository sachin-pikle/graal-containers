## Store your GitHub PAT, OCR user and OCR password in the OCI Vault

***Note: Since an OCI Vault is an expensive resource, we highly recommend using a single Vault shared by multiple users in your tenancy.***

1. If your tenancy doesn't have an OCI Vault already provisioned, create a new OCI Vault in the your compartment. 
    ***We do NOT need a private vault for this lab.***

    ```
    Create in Compartment: dev
    
    Name: shared-vault

    Make it a virtual private vault: NO (LEAVE THE BOX UNCHECKED)
    ```

2. In this Vault, create a master encryption key (mode: Software) in the same compartment.

    ```
    Create in Compartment: dev

    Protection Mode: Software
    
    Name: master-key

    Key Shape Algorithm: AES (Symmetric key for Encrypt and Decrypt)
    
    Key Shape Length: 256 bits
    
    Import External key: NO (LEAVE THE BOX UNCHECKED)
    ```

3. In this Vault, create a secret for your `GitHub personal access token (PAT)` in the same compartment.

    ```
    Create in Compartment: dev
    
    Encryption Key: master-key (Select the master key created above)
    
    Secret Type Template: Plain-Text
    
    Secret Contents: (Paste the secret value)
    
    Show Base64 conversion: YES
    ```

4. In this Vault, create a secret for your `Oracle Container Registry (OCR) user` in the same compartment.

5. In this Vault, create a secret for your `Oracle Container Registry (OCR) password` in the same compartment.

6. Go to the [build_spec_native_exec_ee.yaml](../devops-build-spec/build_spec_native_exec_ee.yaml) file and update the OCID value of the `REGISTRY_USER` and `REGISTRY_PASS` in the `vaultVariables` section.

7. Go to the [build_spec_jar_ee.yaml](../devops-build-spec/build_spec_jar_ee.yaml) file and update the OCID value of the `REGISTRY_USER` and `REGISTRY_PASS` in the `vaultVariables` section.
