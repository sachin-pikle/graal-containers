## Use OCI DevOps

Let's see how we can automate the build and deployment using the OCI DevOps service.

### DevOps Dynamic Groups and IAM Policies

#### DevOps Connections and Repositories

1. Create a dynamic group for all DevOps Connections and Repositories in your compartment.
    ```
    Name: dg-dev-comp-devops-conn-repo

    Description: Dynamic group for all DevOps Connections and Repositories in compartment dev

    Matching Rules:
        Match any rules defined below
        
        Rule 1
            ALL {resource.type = 'devopsconnection', resource.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaa...xyz'}

        Rule 2
            ALL {resource.type = 'devopsrepository', resource.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaa...xyz'}

    ```

2. In your compartment, create a policy to allow DevOps Connections and Repositories to access your GitHub personal access token (PAT) from the OCI Vault.
    ```
    Compartment: dev

    Name: devops-vault-access

    Description: Policy to allow DevOps Connections and Repositories to access your GitHub/GitLab PAT from the Vault

    Policy Statements:
        Allow dynamic-group dg-dev-comp-devops-conn-repo to read secret-family in compartment dev

    ```

#### DevOps Build Pipelines

1. Create a dynamic group for all DevOps Build Pipelines in your compartment.
    ```
    Name: dg-dev-comp-devops-build-pipeline

    Description: Dynamic group for all DevOps Build Pipelines in compartment dev

    Matching Rules:
        Match any rules defined below
        
        Rule 1
            ALL {resource.type = 'devopsbuildpipeline', resource.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaa...xyz'}

    ```

2. In your compartment, create a policy for DevOps build pipelines.
    ```
    Compartment: dev

    Name: devops-build-pipelines-policies

    Description: Policy needed for DevOps build pipelines

    Policy Statements:
        Allow dynamic-group dg-dev-comp-devops-build-pipeline to manage repos in compartment dev
        
        Allow dynamic-group dg-dev-comp-devops-build-pipeline to read secret-family in compartment dev
        
        Allow dynamic-group dg-dev-comp-devops-build-pipeline to manage devops-family in compartment dev
        
        Allow dynamic-group dg-dev-comp-devops-build-pipeline to manage generic-artifacts in compartment dev
        
        Allow dynamic-group dg-dev-comp-devops-build-pipeline to use ons-topics in compartment dev

    ```

#### DevOps Deployment Pipelines

1. Create a dynamic group for all DevOps Deployment Pipelines in your compartment.
    ```
    Name: dg-dev-comp-devops-deploy-pipeline

    Description: Dynamic group for all DevOps Deployment Pipelines in compartment dev

    Matching Rules:
        Match any rules defined below
        
        Rule 1
            ALL {resource.type = 'devopsdeploypipeline', resource.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaa...qba'}

    ```

2. In your compartment, create a policy for Deployment Pipelines. 
    ```
    Compartment: dev

    Name: devops-deploy-pipelines-policies

    Description: Policy needed for DevOps deploy pipelines

    Policy Statements:
        Allow dynamic-group dg-dev-comp-devops-deploy-pipeline to manage all-resources in compartment ssp-tf-play

    ```
