## Deploy and test the App on OKE

Let's see how we can deploy the app on OKE and test it.

1. If you haven't already, go to the `OCI Console >> Developer Services >> Kubernetes Clusters (OKE)` and create a single node OKE Cluster in your compartment.

2. From the cluster details page, go to `Quick Start >> Access Your Cluster`, download the kubeconfig file and set up your local environment.

3. Mark the OCIR repo as public.

4. Update the value of the `spec.template.spec.containers.image:` in the [kube-manifest_step1_ee.yaml](./kube-manifest_step1_ee.yaml) to use the latest image/tag published to the OCIR repo by the DevOps Build Pipeline in the previous step.

5. Deploy the selected image from the OCIR repo using the following command:
    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f ./kube-manifest_step1_ee.yaml
    ```
    This will deploy the selected image and start the container in your OKE cluster. It will provision an OCI Load Balancer, and expose the application using the external (public) IP address of the load balancer.  

6. Get the load balancer's external (public) IP address by running this command:
    ```shell
    kubectl get svc  -o wide
    ```

7. To test the application running on OKE, go to `http://<EXTERNAL-IP>/jibber` in a browser and you should see a nonsense verse.

8. Mark the OCIR repo as private.
