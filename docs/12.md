## Use DevOps Build Pipelines to build the app JAR with GraalVM Enterprise

1. If you haven't already mirrored your GitHub repo, mirror the GitHub repo `DevOps Project >> Code Repositories >> Mirror repository`.

2. Each time you make a change to the GitHub repo, synchornize the changes in the OCI code repo `DevOps Project >> Code Repositories >> github_graal-containers >> Synchronize now`.

3. Create a `Build pipeline`. 

4. From `Build pipelines >> Parameters`, add a new parameter with the following details:
    ```
    Name: REGISTRY_NAME
    Default value: container-registry.oracle.com
    ```
    Click `+` to add.

5. From `Build pipelines`, add a `Stage >> Managed Build` to the build pipeline. Enter the following details:
    ```
    Stage name: Build the app JAR in the jdk-ee container

    Description: Build the app JAR in the GraalVM jdk-ee container

    Build spec file path: devops-build-spec/build_spec_jar_ee.yaml
    ```
    For the `Primary code repository`, select the following values:
    ```
    Source: Connection type: OCI Code Repository
    
    From the list of repos, select the "github_graal-containers" repo.

    Select Branch: main

    Build source name: gvm
    ```
    **Note:** The `Build source name` is the name of the folder where the build service will check out the code from the repository.

    Leave all other values unchanged.

    Click `Add`.

6. Test the build pipeline by clicking the `Start manual run` button.

7. Add artifact. Enter the following details: 
    ```
    Name: jibber-jar-gvmee22-jdk17

    Type: Container image repository

    Enter the fully qualified path to the image in Container Registry: (replace the values based on your region and tenancy namespace)
        <region-code>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-prefix>/jibber-jar-gvmee22-jdk17:${BUILDRUN_HASH}

        For example, 
        phx.ocir.io/your-tenancy-namespace/gvm/jibber-jar-gvmee22-jdk17:${BUILDRUN_HASH}

    Replace parameters used in this artifact:
        Yes, substitute placeholders
    ```
    Click Add.

8. Add a `Stage >> Deliver artifacts` after the Managed Build stage.
    ```
    Stage name: Push the runtime image containing the app JAR to OCIR

    Description: Push the runtime image containing the app JAR to OCIR

    Select artifacts: jibber-jar-gvmee22-jdk17

    Associate artifacts with build result:
        Destination DevOps artifact name: jibber-jar-gvmee22-jdk17
        Type: Docker image
        Build config/result artifact name: Build_output_image (should match the "name" of the "outputArtifacts" from your build_spec_jar_ee.yml file)
    ```
    Click `Add`.

9. Go to OCIR and create an empty Private Repository named `<repo-prefix>/jibber-jar-gvmee22-jdk17` e.g., `gvm/jibber-jar-gvmee22-jdk17` in your compartment.

10. Test the build pipeline again by clicking the `Start manual run` button. The runtime image should be pushed to the OCIR repo. 

11. To test the image on local, 
    - Update the image and tag in the docker-compose.yml file for the `jibber-jar-gvmee-jdk17` service. 
    - As the OCIR repo is private, you will need to docker login to OCIR in your region. Note that OCIR stands for OCI Registry which is different from OCR (Oracle Container Registry).
    - If you haven't already logged in, run `docker login <region-code>.ocir.io` e.g., `docker login phx.ocir.io` in a terminal window. When prompted, enter your `<tenancy-namespace>/<OCI-user-name>` as the Username, and your `<auth-token>` as the Password. 
    - Run `docker compose up --remove-orphans` to start the application on port 8081.
    - Run `docker ps -a` to check status of the running container.
    - Go to http://localhost:8081/jibber in a browser and you should see a nonsense verse.
    - Run `docker compose stop` in another terminal window to stop the application.
