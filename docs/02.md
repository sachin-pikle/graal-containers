## App Native Executable

### Build the App Native Executable

You can use GraalVM Native Image to generate a native executable for this app. We have a shell script that uses multistage Docker build to build the app JAR, generate the app native executable and ship the native executable in a separate runtime docker image.

```bash
./scripts/build-native-exec-ee.sh
```
If you are prompted to `docker login` to OCR, enter your OCR user and password.

**Note:** To use the GraalVM Community edition instead of the GraalVM Enterprise edition, use `./scripts/build-native-exec-ce.sh`

Run this command to see the new docker image:

```bash
docker images -a
```

The output is similar to:
```
REPOSITORY                TAG     IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
jibber-ni-gvmee22-jdk17   0.0.1   daa1a94f4104   24 seconds ago   75.9MB
```

For GraalVM Community edition, the output is similar to:
```
REPOSITORY                TAG     IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
jibber-ni-gvmce22-jdk17   0.0.1   4334c3b5185c   24 seconds ago   91.1MB
```


### Troubleshoot Native Image Build Errors

You may see this error while generating the native executable.

```
Image build request failed with exit status 137
```

Exit status 137 indicates an out of memory error. Try increasing the memory for Docker resource. On Mac, go to Docker Desktop >> Settings >> Resources. Increase the memory to 8 GB or higher.

### Run the App Native Executable

A Docker Compose file has ben provided that will start the container. Most sections have been commented out. Feel free to uncomment sections, as needed.

Go to [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml), comment the `jibber-jar-gvmee-jdk17:` section. Uncomment the `jibber-ni-gvmee-jdk17:` section and run the following command to run the app native executable.

**Note:** For GraalVM Community edition, uncomment the `jibber-ni-gvmce-jdk17:` section. 

```bash
docker compose up --remove-orphans
```

This will start the app native executable on port 8082. Go to http://localhost:8082/jibber in a browser and you should see a nonsense verse.

For GraalVM Community edition, this will start the app native executable on port 8083. Go to http://localhost:8083/jibber in a browser and you should see a nonsense verse.


### Stop the App Native Executable

From another terminal window, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose stop
```
