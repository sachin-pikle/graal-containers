## Use DevOps Deployment Pipelines to deploy the app native executable on OKE

1. If you haven't already, go to the `OCI Console >> Developer Services >> Kubernetes Clusters (OKE)` and create a single node OKE Cluster in your compartment.

2. Create an Environment to point to your OKE Cluster `DevOps Project >> Environments >> Create Environment`. Enter the following details:
    ```
    Environment Type: Oracle Kubernetes Engine

    Name: ssp-oke-cluster

    Description: OKE Cluster

    Click Next.

    Select your region and compartment.

    Select a cluster.
    ```
    Click `Create Environment`.

3. Create the Kubernetes Manifest in the OCI Artifact Registry. Create a new Artifact Repository. Upload Artifact. 
    ```
    Artifact path: Oracle Kubernetes Engine

    Version: ssp-oke-cluster

    Upload method: Console

    Content file: Drag and drop
    ```
