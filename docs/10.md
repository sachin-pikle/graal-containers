## Use OCI DevOps to build the app native executable using GraalVM Community Edition

1. If you haven't already mirrored your GitHub repo, mirror the GitHub repo `DevOps Project >> Code repositories >> Mirror repository`.

2. Each time you make a change to the GitHub repo, synchornize the changes in the OCI. `DevOps Project >> Code repositories >> github_graal-containers >> Synchronize now`.

3. Create a `Build pipeline`. 

4. From `Build pipelines`, add a `Stage >> Managed Build` to the build pipeline. Enter the following details:
    ```
    Stage name: Build the app native executable in the native-image container

    Description: Build the app native executable in the native-image container

    Build spec file path: build_spec_step1_ce.yaml
    ```
    For the `Primary code repository`, select the following values:
    ```
    Source: Connection type: OCI Code Repository
    
    From the list of repos, select the "github_graal-containers" repo.

    Select Branch: main

    Build source name: gvmce-native
    ```
    Leave all other values unchanged. 
    
    Click `Add`.

7. Test the build pipeline by clicking the `Start manual run` button.

8. Add artifact. Enter the following details: 
    ```
    Name: jibber-ni-gvmce22-jdk17

    Type: Container image repository

    Enter the fully qualified path to the image in Container Registry: (replace the values based on your region and tenancy namespace)
        phx.ocir.io/your-tenancy-namespace/gvm/jibber-ni-gvmce22-jdk17:${BUILDRUN_HASH}

    Replace parameters used in this artifact:
        Yes, substitute placeholders
    ```
    Click Add.

9. Add a `Stage >> Deliver artifacts` after the Managed Build stage.
    ```
    Stage name: Push the runtime image containing the app native executable to OCIR

    Description: Push the runtime image containing the app native executable to OCIR

    Select artifacts: jibber-ni-gvmce22-jdk17

    Associate artifacts with build result:
        Destination DevOps artifact name: jibber-ni-gvmce22-jdk17
        Type: Docker image
        Build config/result artifact name: Build_output_image (should match the "name" of the "outputArtifacts" from your build_spec_step1_ce.yml file)
    ```
    Click `Add`.

10. Go to OCIR and create an empty Private Repository named `gvm/jibber-ni-gvmce22-jdk17` in your compartment.

11. Test the build pipeline again by clicking the `Start manual run` button. The runtime image should be pushed to the OCIR repo. 

12. To test the image on local, 
    - Mark the OCIR repo as public. 
    - Update the image tag in the docker-compose.yml file for the `jibber-ni-gvmce-jdk17` service. 
    - Run `docker-compose up --remove-orphans` to start the application on port 8080.
    - Run `docker ps -a` to check status of the running container.
    - Go to http://localhost:8083/jibber in a browser and you should see a nonsense verse.
    - Run `docker-compose stop` in another terminal window to stop the application.
    - Mark the OCIR repo as private.
