## Use DevOps Deployment Pipelines to deploy the app native executable on OKE

1. If you haven't already, go to the `OCI Console >> Developer Services >> Kubernetes Clusters (OKE)` and create a single node OKE Cluster in your compartment.

2. Create an Environment to point to your OKE Cluster `DevOps Project >> Environments >> Create Environment`. Enter the following details:
    ```
    Environment Type: Oracle Kubernetes Engine

    Name: ssp-oke-cluster

    Description: OKE Cluster

    Click Next.

    Select your region and compartment.

    Select a cluster.
    ```
    Click `Create Environment`.

3. Create the Kubernetes Manifest in the OCI Artifact Registry. Create a new Artifact Repository. Upload Artifact. 
    ```
    Artifact path: Oracle Kubernetes Engine

    Version: ssp-oke-cluster

    Upload method: Console

    Content file: Drag and drop
    ```

9. Check the status of the deployment.
    ```shell
    kubectl get deployments -o wide
    ```

10. Check the status of the pod.
    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -o wide
    ```

11. Get the load balancer's external (public) IP address by running this command:
    ```shell
    kubectl get svc -o wide
    ```

12. To test the app running on OKE, go to `http://<EXTERNAL-IP>/jibber` in a browser and you should see a nonsense verse.

13. To check the pod logs, run this command:
    ```shell
    kubectl logs -l app=jibber-ni-gvmee22-jdk17
    ```

14. To delete the OCI Load Balancer and the app-related resources (deployment, pod, service) from the OKE cluster:
    ```shell
    kubectl delete -f ./oke-manifests/oke_manifest_native_exec_ee.yaml
    ```

    The output is similar to:
    ```
    deployment.apps "jibber-ni-gvmee22-jdk17-deploy" deleted
    service "jibber-ni-gvmee22-jdk17-service" deleted
    ```
